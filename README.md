# imagePreproc
Old image preprocessing scripts (basic and fractal filtration)

This is an old implementation of different filtrating functions:
  - Amplitude filtration
  - Max amplitude filtration
  - Roberts filter
  - Previtt filter
  - Sobel filter
  - Marr-Hildret filter
  - Canny filter
  - Deriche filter
  - Kirsch filter

Moreover, there you can find filtrations based on different methods counting local fractal dimension:
  - Mass-radius relation
  - Gray box-counting
  - Color box-counting
  - Gray triangle (pyramidal)
  - Modified mass-radius relation


Existing functions and methods are in serious need to rewrite.

Main code wasn't updated to reworked coloring methods.
